If I kiss you where it's sore
If I kiss you where it's sore
will you feel better
better better
will you feel anything at all
will you feel better
better better
will you feel anything at all
Born like sisters to this world
in a town where blood ties are
only blood
If you never say your name out
loud to anyone
they can never
ever call you by it
If I kiss you where it's sore
If I kiss you where it's sore
will you feel better
better better
will you feel anything at all
will you feel better
better better
will you feel anything at all
la la la la la la
You're getting sadder
sadder getting sadder
getting sadder
and I don't understand
and I don't understand
but if I kiss you
where it's sore
If I kiss you where it's sore
will you feel better
better better
will you feel anything at all
will you feel better
better better
will you feel anything at all
anything at all
Will you feel anything at all
anything at all
